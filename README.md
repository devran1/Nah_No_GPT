This code is influenced by Andrej Karpathy's lecture videos and the following code repositories.

A numpy implementation of NanoGPT without backprop so far. I will add the backprop in the future. Have you seen what I did with the name?

Loss is random and the output doesn't make sense because there is no backprop.

A quick note on the naming conventions: I used block_size and n_embd interchangeably, as well as head_size and batch_size, so it became a little bit confusing.
